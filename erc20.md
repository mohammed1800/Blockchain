## Below are listed steps on how to deploy ERC-20 or how to create a token

## Using Metamask
1. Create metamask wallet using the metamask extension or app and save the wallet address
2. Connect to Goreli Test-network in settings
3. Mine GoreliETH using this link (https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/)
4. Claim 0.01 GoerliETH or more.

Your metamask account should look something like this after mining the GoreliETH

## 20 lab
1. Go to given link: https://20lab.app/ (20lab is an ERC-20 token generator tool)
2. Click on open app>Start
3. Connect your wallet using connect wallet button and select metamask then once you see your account click on connect.
4. Choose blockchain Goreli(Testnet), then enter your Token name, Token symbol, Initial supply (take very large number), 18 Decimals.
5. Select your desired options and click validate & compile, it will open metamask and ask for gas fee for deploying your token
6. View your token name and address in dashboard

For me, I named my token as mobi token and kept its symbol MOB

## Now, to see the transaction history of the token go to https://goerli.etherscan.io/ and paste your token address from 20 lab
